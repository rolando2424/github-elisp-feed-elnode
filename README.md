However you can still use this code as an example of using elnode with Heroku.

Inspired by Zach's
[feed for new Common Lisp repos](http://xach.livejournal.com/298220.html).

The code was based on [technomancy's example of a elnode app hosted in heroku](https://github.com/technomancy/commodore-night-vision).

You can find the feed in [Gwene.org](http://gwene.org) with the name `gwene.com.herokuapp.github-elisp`
